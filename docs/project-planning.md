<!-- MR Capstone Project "PhotoLoto" -->

<!-- Definition Statement -->
## I want to create a web application that allows fellow photographers have an easier time to find nearby events/landmarks. This also applies for visitors/friends who will be in the city.

<!-- Define Audience -->
## My focus is to direct street photographers to areas that are highly recognized. The second part of the audience is to apply this same concept to visitors and travelers who want to see the sights/landmarks of the city.

<!-- Research -->
### Applications that are similiar to what I want in my capstone project : https://foursquare.com/city-guide https://www.airbnb.com/
#### Foursquare : Having the list of highlighted pins to the left of the map is appealing and intuitive like Google maps. Although it does not redirect to a maps app, instead it goes to another page on the website
#### AirBnB : What I like specifically in AirBnB is the layout and how easy it is on the eyes. There may be a lot of content, but is spaced accordingly.
#### I want my application to have the functionality of redirecting to google maps/apple maps. I will try to emulate AirBnB in terms of spacing but not make direct copy. To summarize; The fluidity of AirBnB when it comes the UI and the layout of foursquare's content with mapping.
